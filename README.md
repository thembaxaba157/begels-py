This project is my solution the Begels problem from The Big Book of Small Python Projects

Description:
  In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you
  must guess a secret three-digit number
  based on clues. The game offers one of
  the following hints in response to your guess:
  “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the
  wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct
  digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess
  has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the
  secret number.
